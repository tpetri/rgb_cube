 * Name: sched_waitpid
 *
 * Description:
 *
 *   The waitpid() functions will obtain status information pertaining to one
 *   of the caller's child processes. The waitpid() function will suspend
 *   execution of the calling thread until status information for one of the
 *   terminated child processes of the calling process is available, or until
 *   delivery of a signal whose action is either to execute a signal-catching
 *   function or to terminate the process. If more than one thread is suspended
 *   in waitpid() awaiting termination of the same process, exactly one thread
 *   will return the process status at the time of the target process
 *   termination. If status information is available prior to the call to
 *   waitpid(), return will be immediate.
 *
 *   The pid argument specifies a set of child processes for which status is
 *   requested. The waitpid() function will only return the status of a child
 *   process from this set:
 *
 *   - If pid is equal to (pid_t)-1, status is requested for any child process.
 *     In this respect, waitpid() is then equivalent to wait().
 *   - If pid is greater than 0, it specifies the process ID of a single child
 *     process for which status is requested.
 *   - If pid is 0, status is requested for any child process whose process
 *     group ID is equal to that of the calling process.
 *   - If pid is less than (pid_t)-1, status is requested for any child process
 *     whose process group ID is equal to the absolute value of pid.
 *
 *   The options argument is constructed from the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero
 *   or more of the following flags, defined in the <sys/wait.h> header:
 *
 *   WCONTINUED - The waitpid() function will report the status of any
 *     continued child process specified by pid whose status has not been
 *     reported since it continued from a job control stop.  
 *   WNOHANG - The waitpid() function will not suspend execution of the
 *    calling thread if status is not immediately available for one of the
 *    child processes specified by pid. 
 *   WUNTRACED - The status of any child processes specified by pid that are
 *    stopped, and whose status has not yet been reported since they stopped,
 *    will also be reported to the requesting process. 
 *
 *   If the calling process has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or has SIGCHLD set to
 *   SIG_IGN, and the process has no unwaited-for children that were
 *   transformed into zombie processes, the calling thread will block until all
 *   of the children of the process containing the calling thread terminate, and
 *   waitpid() will fail and set errno to ECHILD. 
 *
 *   If waitpid() returns because the status of a child process is available,
 *   these functions will return a value equal to the process ID of the child
 *   process. In this case, if the value of the argument stat_loc is not a
 *   null pointer, information will be stored in the location pointed to by
 *   stat_loc. The value stored at the location pointed to by stat_loc will be
 *   0 if and only if the status returned is from a terminated child process
 *   that terminated by one of the following means:
 *
 *   1. The process returned 0 from main().
 *   2. The process called _exit() or exit() with a status argument of 0.
 *   3. The process was terminated because the last thread in the process terminated.
 *
 *   Regardless of its value, this information may be interpreted using the
 *   following macros, which are defined in <sys/wait.h> and evaluate to
 *   integral expressions; the stat_val argument is the integer value pointed
 *   to by stat_loc.
 *
 *   WIFEXITED(stat_val) - Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was
 *     returned for a child process that terminated normally. 
 *   WEXITSTATUS(stat_val) - If the value of WIFEXITED(stat_val) is non-zero,
 *     this macro evaluates to the low-order 8 bits of the status argument
 *     that the child process passed to _exit() or exit(), or the value the
 *     child process returned from main(). 
 *   WIFSIGNALED(stat_val) - Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was
 *     returned for a child process that terminated due to the receipt of a
 *     signal that was not caught (see <signal.h>). 
 *   WTERMSIG(stat_val)  - If the value of WIFSIGNALED(stat_val) is non-zero,
 *     this macro evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the
 *     termination of the child process. 
 *   WIFSTOPPED(stat_val) - Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was
 *     returned for a child process that is currently stopped. 
 *   WSTOPSIG(stat_val) - If the value of WIFSTOPPED(stat_val) is non-zero,
 *     this macro evaluates to the number of the signal that caused the child
 *     process to stop. 
 *   WIFCONTINUED(stat_val) - Evaluates to a non-zero value if status was
 *    returned for a child process that has continued from a job control stop.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   pid - The task ID of the thread to waid for
 *   stat_loc - The location to return the exit status
 *   options - ignored
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   If waitpid() returns because the status of a child process is available,
 *   it will return a value equal to the process ID of the child process for
 *   which status is reported.
 *
 *   If waitpid() returns due to the delivery of a signal to the calling
 *   process, -1 will be returned and errno set to EINTR.
 *
 *   If waitpid() was invoked with WNOHANG set in options, it has at least
 *   one child process specified by pid for which status is not available, and
 *   status is not available for any process specified by pid, 0 is returned.
 *
 *   Otherwise, (pid_t)-1 will be returned, and errno set to indicate the error:
 *
 *   ECHILD - The process specified by pid does not exist or is not a child of
 *     the calling process, or the process group specified by pid does not exist
 *     or does not have any member process that is a child of the calling process. 
 *   EINTR - The function was interrupted by a signal. The value of the location
 *     pointed to by stat_loc is undefined. 
 *   EINVAL - The options argument is not valid. 
 *
 * Assumptions:
