 * Name: os_bringup
 *
 * Description:
 *   Start all initial system tasks.  This does the "system bring-up" after
 *   the conclusion of basic OS initialization.  These initial system tasks
 *   may include:
 *
 *   - pg_worker:   The page-fault worker thread (only if CONFIG_PAGING is
 *                  defined.
 *   - work_thread: The work thread.  This general thread can be used to
 *                  perform most any kind of queued work.  Its primary
 *                  function is to serve as the "bottom half" of device
 *                  drivers.
 *
 *   And the main application entry point.  This may be one of two different
 *   symbols:
 *
 *   - USER_ENTRYPOINT: This is the default entry point used for all of the
 *                  example code in apps/examples.
 *   - CONFIG_BUILTIN_APP_START: The system can also be configured to start
 *                  custom applications at however CONFIG_BUILTIN_APP_START
 *                  is defined in the NuttX start-up file.
 *
