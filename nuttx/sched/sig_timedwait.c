/****************************************************************************
 * Name: sigtimedwait
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function selects the pending signal set specified by the argument
 *   set.  If multiple signals are pending in set, it will remove and return
 *   the lowest numbered one.  If no signals in set are pending at the time
 *   of the call, the calling process will be suspended until one of the
 *   signals in set becomes pending, OR until the process is interrupted by
 *   an unblocked signal, OR until the time interval specified by timeout
 *   (if any), has expired. If timeout is NULL, then the timeout interval
 *   is forever.
 *
 *   If the info argument is non-NULL, the selected signal number is stored
 *   in the si_signo member and the cause of the signal is store in the
 *   si_code emember.  The content of si_value is only meaningful if the
 *   signal was generated by sigqueue().
 *
 *   The following values for si_code are defined in signal.h:
 *     SI_USER    - Signal sent from kill, raise, or abort
 *     SI_QUEUE   - Signal sent from sigqueue
 *     SI_TIMER   - Signal is result of timer expiration
 *     SI_ASYNCIO - Signal is the result of asynch IO completion 
 *     SI_MESGQ   - Signal generated by arrival of a message on an
 *                  empty message queue.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   set - The pending signal set.
 *   info - The returned value
 *   timeout - The amount of time to wait
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   Signal number that cause the wait to be terminated, otherwise -1 (ERROR)
 *   is returned with errno set to either:
 *
 *   EAGAIN - No signal specified by set was generated within the specified
 *            timeout period.
 *   EINTR  - The wait was interrupted by an unblocked, caught signal.
 *
 * Assumptions:
